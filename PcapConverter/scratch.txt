Notes:
PCAP is a standardized format defined by the IEEE standard
https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-gharris-opsawg-pcap-01.html


File format is based on octets

Useful conversions for octets
    - 32 bits
    - 4 bytes in C#
    - 1 uint in C#
    - (span?)
    - 3 octets to denote information based on the standard

24 octets in a header or 192 bits
 - starts with magic number 
    - 0xA1B2C3D4 denotes seconds and microseconds
    - 0xA1B23C4D denotes seconds and nanoseconds
 - next row is version
    - first half of octet is major version
    - second half of octet is minor version
 - next 2 rows are reserved and have to be filled with 0's for writers and ignored for readers
 - next row is unsigned 32 bit int 
    - the value should be a number greater than or equal to the largest packet length in the file
 - final octet is split in half
    - first half(16 bits) is Frame Cyclic Sequence
        - First 3 bits are fcs
        - 4th bit is on/off switch
            - if the "f" bit is set, then the 3 FCS bits provide the number of 16-bit (2 byte) words of FCS that are appended to each packet valid values are between 0 and 7, with ethernet typically having a length of 4 bytes, or a value of 2.
            - next 12 bits MUST be 0
    - second half(16 bits) is the LinkType

16 octets in packet header
    - 1st octet is seconds since start of unix time
    - 2nd octet is microseconds if magic header is 0xA1B2C3D4
    - 3rd octet is captured packet length must be Min(SnapLength, OriginalPacketLength)
    - 4th octet is original packet length
    
    - packet data length is based on packet header
   

file header(24 octets) -> packet header(16 octets) -> packet data(variable length) -> packet header -> packet data -> etc...
